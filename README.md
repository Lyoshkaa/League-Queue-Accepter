# League-Queue-Accepter
A simple python script that automatically accepts the queue pop when it appears

The script only works when:
1- League is on your primary monitor
2- League client as at full resolution, and is in the middle of your screen
3- Nothing is blocking the client. Like another application like your browser or discord.
