# League-Queue-Accepter\n
A simple python script that automatically accepts the queue pop when it appears\n

The script only works when:\n
1- League is on your primary monitor\n
2- League client as at full resolution, and is in the middle of your screen\n
3- Nothing is blocking the client. Like another application like your browser or discord.
